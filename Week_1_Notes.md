# Week 1 Notes

- Machine Learning: The ability for a program to learn without being explicitly told how to

- There's a couple major types of learning algorithms
    - Supervised Learning
    - Unsupervised Learning
    - Recommender Systems
    - Reinforcement Learning

- Supervised Learning
    - Deals with X -> Y mapping: You give it a bunch of input X, and it tries to output a value Y
    - A key part is to supply this learning algorithm with a bunch of "correct" examples
    - There's two types of supervised learning:
        - Regression: Predicting continuous values (i.e. numbers)
        - Classification: Predicting which bucket a value falls into (i.e. think an enum or bool)

- Unsupervised Learning
    - You're given a set of data and just told "Hey find some structure out of this"
    - Most commonly its a clustering algorithm (group things into buckets)
    - But could also be anomaly detection or dimensionality reduction
