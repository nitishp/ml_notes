# Foundations of Convoluational Neural Networks

## Convolutional Neural Networks
* In computer vision, we want to be able to use large images. But if we feed each pixel of the input as a parameter to the ML model, we'll have to train way too many parameters
* Convolution operator:
  * Notation is $*$ (same as multiplication)
  * Think of this like applying a "filter" to the matrix
  * Example:
