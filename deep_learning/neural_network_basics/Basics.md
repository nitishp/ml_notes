# What is a neural network

* Neural Network basics
    * Comprised of a set of neurons working together
    * Each neuron can have different activation functions:
        * Linear
        * Sigmoid
        * ReLU
    * They can feed into one another, but you never train individual neurons to learn a specific thing
        * So they infer the middle/hidden "features" automatically
* Has provided a lot of value in supervised learning in particular
    * Different problems have different neural network architectures
        * RNN - Normally used for things like audio
        * CNN - Normally used for image data
    * Types of data
        * Structured data - tabular data (think like a SQL table)
        * Unstructured data - Audio, image, text
* Why has deep learning taken off so recently?
    * Large neural nets perform much better when there's a large amount of data
    * The amount of data as well as our computation algorithms / hardware have become much better over the last 10 years
